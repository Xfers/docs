# API endpoints

Xfers provides a **dedicated sandbox environment** where you can simulate an incoming bank transfer for testing purposes.
Note that this feature will not be available in production mode. Refer to the [testing section to get started](#testing).

```php
<?php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

# SG: Singapore

# Set one of the following endpoints below:
\Xfers\Xfers::setSGProduction();
\Xfers\Xfers::setSGSandbox();
\Xfers\Xfers::setIDProduction();
\Xfers\Xfers::setIDSandbox();
```

```python
# SG: Singapore
# ID: Indonesia
# Set one of the following endpoints below:
import xfers
xfers.set_sg_production()
xfers.set_sg_sandbox()

xfers.set_id_sandbox()
```

```ruby

# Set one of the following endpoints below:
require 'xfers'
Xfers.set_sg_production

```

```java

For testing purposes, we highly recommend that your head over to [sandbox.xfers.io](https://sandbox.xfers.io) and create a sandbox account.

While in testing mode, point to our sandbox API endpoint at:

Singapore:
`https://sandbox.xfers.io/api/v3`

Indonesia:`https://sandbox-id.xfers.com/api/v3`

To switch to production, point to our production API endpoint at:

Singapore: `https://www.xfers.io/api/v3`

Indonesia: `https://id.xfers.com/api/v3`


<aside class="notice">
Sandbox and Production are two separate environments. Please ensure your register for an account at EACH environment and use their individual API Key.

All the examples code in this document will be pointing to our sandbox endpoint.

Note that all API calls are done through HTTPS, please do not attempt to hit our endpoint via HTTP, as you will also be
exposing your API key in plain text.
